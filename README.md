## Introduction

This project revolves around the MySQL World database, which has been used to perform various data manipulation tasks and gain insights into geographic and demographic information.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to showcase the data manipulation capabilities of MySQL through various queries on the World database.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the World database, a widely-used database that contains information about countries, cities, languages, and more.

## Data Manipulation

Data manipulation in this project involves retrieving, filtering, and analyzing data using MySQL queries.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL**: MySQL is the primary tool employed for data manipulation in this project.

## Key Insights

The project uncovers a range of key insights from the World database, shedding light on various aspects of countries, cities, and demographics.

## Example Queries

The following SQL queries have been performed on the dataset to extract valuable information:

1. Using `COUNT`, get the number of cities in the USA.

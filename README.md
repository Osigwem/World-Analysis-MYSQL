## Introduction

This project revolves around the MySQL World database, which has been used to perform various data manipulation tasks and gain insights into geographic and demographic information.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to showcase the data manipulation capabilities of MySQL through various queries on the World database.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the World database, a widely-used database that contains information about countries, cities, languages, and more.

## Data Manipulation

Data manipulation in this project involves retrieving, filtering, and analyzing data using MySQL queries.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL**: MySQL is the primary tool employed for data manipulation in this project.

## Key Insights

The project uncovers a range of key insights from the World database, shedding light on various aspects of countries, cities, and demographics.

## Example Queries

The following SQL queries have been performed on the dataset to extract valuable information:

1. Using `COUNT`, get the number of cities in the USA.
2. Find out the population and life expectancy for people in Argentina (ARG).
3. Using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, determine the country with the highest life expectancy.
4. Select 25 cities around the world that start with the letter 'F' in a single SQL query.
5. Create a SQL statement to display columns Id, Name, Population from the city table and limit results to the first 10 rows only.
6. Create a SQL statement to find only those cities from the city table whose population is larger than 2,000,000.
7. Create a SQL statement to find all city names from the city table whose name begins with the "Be" prefix.
8. Create a SQL statement to find only those cities from the city table whose population is between 500,000 and 1,000,000.
9. Create a SQL statement to find a city with the lowest population in the city table.
10. Create a SQL statement to find the capital of Spain (ESP).
11. Create a SQL statement to list all the languages spoken in the Caribbean region.
12. Create a SQL statement to find all cities from the Europe continent.
